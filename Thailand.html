                Upon initally arriving to Suvarnabhumi International Airport, I was met with an anxiety I had never felt before in my life. Every single second on the phone, every day
                spent waiting for this moment was finally hitting me. I had just traveled over 22 hours with the intention of meeting a girl from the Internet. As I moved through immigration
                and collected my oversized suitcase reality hit. Just around that corner was the girl I had spent over 2 years talking to online and it was finally time to move forward and meet her.
                I rounded the corner and proceeded to drop of area 4 where her family was waiting for me. I instantly locked eyes with her as she grabbed her younger sister to hide behind. I made a
                full sprint through the drop off area and gave her the biggest hug ever. I was so glad to be meeting her for the first time and she was even more beautiful than I thought.
                I was shocked that her entire family was waiting, I believed that just her Mom and Sister were going to be escorting me back to the village however her Brother and his Girlfriend
                that I had only known VIA Facebook had tagged along. Meeting someone for the first time after flying for almost 24 and instantly connecting has to be the best feeling in the world.
                I remember after our first hug and kiss just thinking about the dread of May 10th, the day I would leave a potential love of my life behind for the western world. I cried on April 29th
                3 times; Once because I had never felt this way with anyone before let alone had a western woman interested in me, the 2nd time because she took care of me on my birthday, and the 3rd
                because she bought me a cake when nobody else (other than family) had done that for me. I always told her how much I like cat memes and she went and found a bakery that would make
                a custom cat cake with the writing "I love you Logan". Even thinking about that day I still get teary eyed and sad, its something that may be so small to others but means the world to me.

                After all the excitement and anxierty had weakened, we were in the car together headed to our first date spot <a href="https://thesmartlocal.co.th/747-cafe/">747 Cafe.</a>
                As an aviation geek there was one thing I couldn't stop talking about for the months leading up to my departure. The aircraft I would be taking. By the time I was leaving the USA 
                she must have heard about the Airbus A350-900 a few hundred times. I had always enjoyed watching the overseas flights depart and it would be my first time actually flying on one.
                I had constantly watched videos about China Airlines, the airline that would take me all the way from Seattle to Bangkok. During my research I found videos of this cafe online
                and asked her to go. She didn't like the idea at first, but after some sweet talking I convinced her to take us here for our first date. After our first date we went and ate
                a traditional Thai meal with her family before I spent the first few hours in her apartment before heading to the hotel. I had a solid 2 days in Bangkok which was spent eating
                local foods, exploring the malls, and using the public transportation as much as possible. After our first few days in Bangkok, the true relationship test would come with us spending
                time traveling through 3 different countries together.
