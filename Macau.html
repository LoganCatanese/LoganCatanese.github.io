                After our casino win in Macau and all of the money spent in Singapore and Hong Kong, we were hoping to hit the jackpot in Macau. We only had 2 days here and upon arrival
                we went to check in at our hotel and were upgraded to a suite! This was already a shocker, as a suite can run you upwards of $400USD a night and comes with all the amentities.
                Upon entry of the suite, it was like a small apartment with a massive circular couch and my name on the TV, a first for me. I was treated with the upmost respect and the staff
                cleaned the room 3 times a day, something that is unthinkable in the USA. We spent most of the first day exploring our hotel, <a href="https://www.studiocity-macau.cn/en">Studio City Macau</a>
                which could be considered a small mall in itself. I took my girfriend to get her first "real" steak at a food court within the hotel that she talks about still. I tried to find a
                similar restaurant for her in Bangkok but was unable to find somewhere serving that type of meal. I assured her as we go through the visa process her first meal in the USA can be a steak.

               Studio city was a wonderful area full of life and nightlife, however, compared to Bangkok most places closed much earlier meaning the earlier you arrived the better
               chance you have at a good experience. We tried to do many things at night other than the casinos but at the end of the day those were the only things entertainment wise
               that we both enjoyed. We also ended up visiting a water park together, something I had experienced many times before but another first for her. I love dating a foreign
               girl because of all the new things we get to teach one another, for example I had to learn how to "Wai". A proper Thai gesture that I will link a video of down below.
               The Wai is a Thai greeting that should be done when meeting a Thai woman's parents for the first time (or anyone for the first time), I had done it many times over the phone but the first time in 
               real life was uncomfortable.
