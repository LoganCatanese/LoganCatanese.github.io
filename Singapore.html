                Singapore is considered one of the richest cities in the world (4th Globally) and has over 242,400 Milionaires. I spent 3 days
                exploring the city and enriching myself in the culture with my girlfriend. She had never left Thailand before and this was our first international trip
                together which can prove to be difficult, let alone after the first time we met each other in real life. Singapore has one of the nicest transportation systems as well
                as 50% of the city covered in green spaces earning it the name "City in a Garden". They also have one of the tallest indoor waterfalls, which I made sure to visit when
                I was in Singapore Changi Airport. We had quite a bit of trouble navigating the public transportation system, but by the end of my 3 days in the city I felt like a pro!
                While we were having a slight disagreement, I saw a video pop up on social media about navigating public transportation (in another country) with your significant other being the true test!
                They say if by the end you have not broken up or argued extensively you are made to be. We are not broken up and only had one argument which I consider a win in my book!

                We also both experienced the casino for the first time, where I ended up hitting the mini jackpot and winning around $300USD. I was concerned about losing a
                lot of money but sticking to the small slots and playing smart seemed to be the way to go. The cost of living in Singapore is considerably higher than Thailand.
                The cost of living in Singapore is almost 300% higher than Thailand and the food and dining is much cheaper in Thailand. A simple meal for the two of us in Thailand
                was around $20USD where in Singapore we were paying close to $40 for a low end restaurant. Overall, this was my first time ever experiencing anything like the city of
                Singapore and I hope to return for another visit next year when I will be spending a considerable amount of time in Thailand.
